 * Unroll ticket changes to that date (trac plugin)? Spider tickets now?
   Spidering seems easier but kind of a shame somehow. We're not talking

 * Do one automatically when any ticket in the report changes? (Actually
   just a cronjob dumping to versioncontrol could accomplish this easier
   in theory.)
