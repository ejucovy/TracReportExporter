 * A companion Trac plugin that unrolls ticket changes to a given date,
   and displays the ticket as of that date. Then in the frozen report,
   we can ask the Trac if it provides that plugin, and if so rewrite
   ticket links to get the tickets unrolled as-of the current date.

   The alternative is spidering tickets now and dumping their frozen
   state, but that feels wrong to me. The primary use case is trusted
   services, and decoupled cooperation seems preferable. Also I think
   it's no disaster if the report doesn't enable this information;
   hopefully the report was designed well enough that all information
   that needs to be frozen in order for the report to be meaningful
   is already there on the report itself.

 * A simple configuration language for setting up one or many of these
   by a cronjob would be nice. There's actually no reason to be smarter
   than a scheduled cronjob, e.g. automatic dumps when any ticket in the
   report changes. That's because reports-over-time are actually more
   meaningful with time as the independent variable ("What's the daily
   rate of changes on this report?") than with changes as the independent
   variable ("What's the frequency over time of changes on this report?")
